\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
%\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
%for IEEE journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
%IEEEtran.cls version 1.7 and later.

The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) Pipeline is an automated data reduction system that generates end-user data products, such as images and calibrated visibilities, from raw VLBA visibility data.  The pipeline also generates diagnostic information to aid end users in assessing the quality of the primary data products.

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
%I wish you the best of success.

\section{Pipeline Installation and Execution}

The pipeline software is part of the larger Obit package\cite{Cotton:Obit}.  To use the pipeline first install Obit\footnote{\tt http://www.cv.nrao.edu/{\tilde}bcotton/Obit.html}.  The pipeline scripts are described in section \ref{files}, below.  Assuming the scripts are copied to a common working directory and the input parameters ({\tt params.py} and {\tt AIPSSetup.py}) properly modified to suit the data of interest and the local computing environment, the pipeline can be started with the command
\begin{quote}\tt \$ python VLBAContPipe.py AIPSSetup.py parms.py\end{quote}
from the shell command line.

\section{Data Reduction Process}

During early development, the details of the data reduction process are likely to change, but the general process will remain the same.  The process is as follows.

Data is loaded from FITS IDI or FITS AIPS files into an AIPS catalog.  Old calibration and editing tables, if present, are removed.  Data is flagged at the beginning and end of each scan and anywhere explicitly described by the user using the appropriate input parameter.  Corrections are made to the signal quantization, parallactic angle, opacity and gain.  The best calibration sources, time range, and reference antenna are found.  Manual phase calibration is performed.  The bandpasses are calibrated.  The calibration sources are imaged.  Models are created using these images.  These models are used to calibrate delays and amplitudes for all sources (including calibrator sources).  All sources are imaged or re-imaged and  plots of the calibrated visibilities are generated.  Data is then output as FITS images, FITS {\em uv} data, FITS tables (with no data), and diagnostic plots.

The pipeline parameters allows the user to control what parts of the above data reduction process are performed during a given run. 

\section{Files} \label{files}

The files used and generated by the pipeline are described here.  All pipeline outputs are written to the current directory.

\subsection{Python Scripts}

The following files can be found within the Obit installation in directory {\tt ObitSystem/Obit/python}, unless otherwise noted.

\begin{description}
\item[\tt VLBAContPipe.py] \hfill \\ This is the top-level pipeline script. It can be divided into three parts.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Required python modules are imported.  
		\item Obit and AIPS initialization variables are defined by calling {\tt AIPSSetup.py}.  Pipeline input parameters are defined using default values when possible.  The script {\tt params.py} is read to set or reset pipeline input parameters for the current data.  
		\item The data reduction process is performed by invoking functions defined in {\tt VLBACal.py}.
	\end{enumerate}

\item[\tt AIPSSetup.py] \hfill \\ Located in \verb|ObitSystem/Obit/share/scripts|, this file initializes python objects and environment variables used by Obit and AIPS.  For example, this file defines the AIPS user number, AIPS disk (data directory), and FITS disk (directory) used by the pipeline, and also sets the number of allowed threads used by the multi-threaded Obit objects.

\item[\tt \emph{parms.py}] \hfill \\ \emph{Eventually, this file will be automatically generated by a script and will hold unique parameter values for each data set.}  For now, Python objects defined with default values in {\tt VLBAContPipe.py} can be copied into this file by hand.  These parameters will then be reassigned with the current data set in mind.  Some of the important information stored in this file includes: the project name, session, and receiver band letter that will be displayed in pipeline output; the input data file(s); calibrator names; and many variables that control which pipeline functions are run and how they run.

\item[\tt VLBACal.py] \hfill \\ This file defines the VLBACal module, which contains functions for editing and calibrating VLBA data.  Documentation for these functions is contained in the Python code.  The documentation can be viewed from a python interpreter using the commands
\begin{quote}\tt 
>>> import VLBACal \\
>>> help(VLBACal)
\end{quote}

\item[\tt VLBALinePipe.py] \hfill \\  This is an early test script for processing spectral line data.  The script may be integrated into the pipeline system in the future.
\end{description}

\subsection{Primary Data Products}

The following data products are written to the current working directory.

\begin{description}
\item[FITS Images] \hfill \\ Images are written to FITS files named {\tt{\em SrcName}.ImgSC.fits}, where {\em SrcName} is replaced by the source name.

\item[Calibrated Visibility Data (multisource)?] \hfill \\ 

\item[Calibrated Visibility Data (single source)?] \hfill \\ 

\item[Calibration Tables (w/o data)?] \hfill %\\
\end{description}

\subsection{Diagnostic Products}

These data products are also written to the current working directory.

\begin{description}

\item[Plots] \hfill \\  Diagnostic plots are written to PostScript files with names {\tt {\em PCode}\_{\em SCode}\_{\em Band}.{\em PlotType}.ps}.  {\em Pcode} is the project code; {\em Scode} is the session code; {\em Band} is the observing band letter; {\em PlotType} is a word describing the contents of the file, such as `AmpCal' or `Opacity'.  (Example: {\tt BL149\_AJ\_U.Opacity.ps}) 
 
\item[Log] \hfill \\ All messages generated during processing are written to a log file named {\tt {\em PCode}\_{\em SCode}\_{\em Band}.log}, where {\em PCode}, {\em SCode}, {\em Band} are described above.  (Example: {\tt BL149\_AJ\_U.log})

\end{description}
